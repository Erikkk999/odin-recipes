    <h2>Hungarian Goulash (beef stew-soup)</h2>
        <p class="dis">If you think of Hungary, then Goulash is probably exactly what comes to mind.<br>
            Unsurprising given it is Hungary&#39;s greatest food export!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="menu">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beef, spices and sauce</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Beef:</strong> The classic beef cut to use is beef chuck which is a tough cut of<br>
                        meat that becomes meltingly tender when slow cooked. If you can, get a<br>
                        single piece so you can cut it into cubes of the size we want, else get a<br>
                        thick steak. Always look for beef that is nicely marbled with fat. All too<br>
                        often, the grocery stores ones are disturbingly lean. We want the fat<br>
                        marbled throughout, it makes the beef so tender and juicy!</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Paprika:</strong> Use Hungarian or Hungarian-style if you can, the paprika is<br>
                        smoother and sweeter than ordinary paprika. Don&#39;t use hot paprika &#8722;<br>
                        we&#39;re using lots of paprika here, it will be way too spicy! Smoked paprika<br>
                        will make the sauce a little too smokey, though you could mix-and-match<br>
                        a little if you want.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Caraway seeds:</strong> A traditional spice used in Goulash used in central<br>
                        European cooking. Not the end of the world if you don&#39;t have it but you&#39;ll<br>
                        love the little unique pops of flavour if you do!</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Beef stock/broth:</strong> The liquid used to make the sauce. Traditionally<br>
                        water was used, but no one can deny that using stock makes the sauce a<br>
                        whole lot tastier! I personally would not make this with water. If you use<br>
                        homemade beef stock, you could sell bowls of this for a pretty penny.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Butter and oil:</strong> The fat for sautéing. I like to use both so you get the best<br>
                        of both worlds &#8722; butter for flavour, oil for effective searing (butter is ~15%<br>
                        water and susceptible to burning at high heats).</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Bay leaf:</strong> For flavour. Fresh if you can, or dried.</p></li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            

             <li><strong>The vegetables</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> flavour base</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Capsicum/bell peppers:</strong> One each red and yellow if you can, or 2 red.<br>
                        Don&#39;t underestimate the flavour this brings to the sauce! You can<br>
                        substitute the potato and carrot but don&#39;t skip capsicum!</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> These break down to naturally thicken the sauce rather than<br>
                        using flour.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Carrot and potato:</strong> Vegetable adds ins that fills it out. Feel free to switch<br>
                         with other root vegetables such as celeriac, parsnip, or even non-root<br>
                         vegetables like green beans. Note: These get added at the end of the<br>
                        cook time so the potato doesn&#39;t disintegrate.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Parsley:</strong> optional garnish</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="menu">
        <ul>
            <li><p>Cut beef into nice size chunks then sprinkle with salt and pepper</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook onion first for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook beef: Next, add the beef all in one go and stir until the surfaces<br>
                changes from red to brown. You won&#39;t be browning on the beef because<br>
                there&#39;s too much in the pot and that&#39;s just how it&#39;s supposed to be. All the<br>
                flavours meld and come together in the next steps!</p></li>
            <li><p>Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes to coat the<br>
                vegetables in all the flavour in the pot. The tomato will mostly breakdown –<br>
                it will break down completing during the slow cooking phase and thicken<br>
                the sauce.</p></li>
        </ul>
