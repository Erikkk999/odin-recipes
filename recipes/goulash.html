    <h2>Hungarian Goulash (beef stew-soup)</h2>
        <p>If you think of Hungary, then Goulash is probably exactly what comes to mind.<br>
            Unsurprising given it is Hungary&#39;s greatest food export!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Beef, spices and sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Beef: The classic beef cut to use is beef chuck which is a tough cut of<br>
                        meat that becomes meltingly tender when slow cooked. If you can, get a<br>
                        single piece so you can cut it into cubes of the size we want, else get a<br>
                        thick steak. Always look for beef that is nicely marbled with fat. All too<br>
                        often, the grocery stores ones are disturbingly lean. We want the fat<br>
                        marbled throughout, it makes the beef so tender and juicy!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Paprika: Use Hungarian or Hungarian-style if you can, the paprika is<br>
                        smoother and sweeter than ordinary paprika. Don&#39;t use hot paprika &#8722;<br>
                        we&#39;re using lots of paprika here, it will be way too spicy! Smoked paprika<br>
                        will make the sauce a little too smokey, though you could mix-and-match<br>
                        a little if you want.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Caraway seeds: A traditional spice used in Goulash used in central<br>
                        European cooking. Not the end of the world if you don&#39;t have it but you&#39;ll<br>
                        love the little unique pops of flavour if you do!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Beef stock/broth: The liquid used to make the sauce. Traditionally<br>
                        water was used, but no one can deny that using stock makes the sauce a<br>
                        whole lot tastier! I personally would not make this with water. If you use<br>
                        homemade beef stock, you could sell bowls of this for a pretty penny.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Butter and oil: The fat for saut√©ing. I like to use both so you get the best<br>
                        of both worlds &#8722; butter for flavour, oil for effective searing (butter is ~15%<br>
                        water and susceptible to burning at high heats).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Bay leaf: For flavour. Fresh if you can, or dried (pictured).</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
