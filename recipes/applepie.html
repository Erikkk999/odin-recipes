    <h2>Apple Pie by Grandma Ople</h2>
        <p class="dis">This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. I have never seen<br>
            another one quite like it! It will always be my favorite and has won several first<br>
            place prizes in local competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for family dinners<br>
            or during the holidays.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="menu">
        <ul>
            <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="menu">
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Peel<br>
                and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste;<br>
                cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a<br>
                boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out<br>
                remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into<br>
                eight 1-inch strips.</li>
            <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four<br> 
                pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the<br>
                center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
            <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're<br>
                almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the|<br>
                second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their<br>
                original position.</li>
            <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused<br>
                strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into<br>
                their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of<br>
                pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.</li>
            <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it<br>
                seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run<br>
                off the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F<br>
                (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
         </ol>
