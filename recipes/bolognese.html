    <h2>Mom's Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
        <p class="dis">Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather.<br>
            The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more<br>
            authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also<br>
            substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="menu">
        <ul>
            <li>500g Fresh Beef Mince</li>
            <li>400g Dried Spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 Rashers of Smoked Streaky Bacon</li>
            <li>2 Tins of Plum/Chopped Tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 Fresh Cherry Tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 Medium Onions</li>
            <li>2 Sticks of Celery</li>
            <li>2 Carrots</li>
            <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>1 Medium Chilli</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Tomato Puree</li>

            <li>Glass of red wine</li>
         </ul>
            </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <div class="menu">
         <ol>
            <li><p>Get yourself a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, and place it on a medium heat.<br>
                Add a good lug of olive oil and gently fry your bacon until golden and crisp,<br>
                then reduce the heat slightly and add your onions, carrots, celery and garlic.<br>
                Next remove the leaves from the Rosemary sprigs and add them to the pot,<br>
                discarding the sprigs. Move everything around and fry for around 8-10 minutes<br>
                until the veg has softened.</p>
                </li>
                
            <li><p>Next, increase the heat slightly, add the mince and stir until the meat is<br>
                browned all over.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Stir in your tins of plum/chopped tomatoes, (plum tomatoes are best as they<br>
                 contain less water, but either will turn out great!). Add your remaining herbs,<br>
                 tomato puree, stock cube, chilli and if using, the wine. Slice your cherry<br>
                 tomatoes in half and throw them in as well.</p></li>
            <li><p>Give everything a stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes as<br>
                 you go and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low-medium, put the<br> 
                 lid on and leave it blipping away for about an hour and 15 minutes until<br>
                 the flavours develop into a wonderfully rich tomatoey sauce. Stir occasionally to<br>
                 make sure it doesn't catch.</p></li>

            <li><p>Just as the sauce is nearly ready, Add the parmesan and season to taste.<br>
                 Meanwhile add salt to a pan of boiling water and cook the spaghetti according<br>
                 the the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is ready, drain it in a colander<br>
                 and add it to the pan with the sauce. Give it all a good stir, coating the pasta in<br>
                 the lovely tomato sauce. Serve with a little grated parmesan and use the extra<br>
                 basil leaves to make a great little garnish. Beautiful!</p></li>
